### 1. Write a program that prints a greeting message. This program should contain a method called greeting that takes a name as its parameter and returns a string.

#def greeting(name)
#  "Hello, #{name}"
#end

#p greeting("James")

### 2. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

#1. x = 2
# Assigns integer 2 to the variable x.

#2. puts x = 2
# prints out the value of the x variable and adds a new line. Returns nil.

#3. p name = "Joe"
# prints out the string assigned to the name variable, and returns the string.

#4. four = "four"
# assigns variable four with a string and returns that string.

#5. print something = "nothing"
# prints the string assigned to the variable. Does not generate a new line, and returns nil.

### 3. Write a program that includes a method called multiply that takes two arguments and returns the product of the two numbers.

#def multiply(a,b)
#  a * b
#end

#multiply(3,4)

### 4. What will the following code print to the screen?

#def scream(words)
#  words = words + "!!!!"
#  return
#  puts words
#end

#scream("Yippeee")

#The previous code will not print anything and will return nil.

### 5. Edit the method definition in exercise #4 so that it does print words on the screen. 2) What does it return now?

#def scream(words)
#  words = words + "!!!!"
#  puts words
#end

#scream("ahhh")
#ahhh!!!!
#=> nil

### 6. The error message gives me a code block that defines a method called "calculate_product". The method requires two entries, and is only being given one between the parantheses after the method.
