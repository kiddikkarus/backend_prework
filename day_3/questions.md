## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
***A statement which may be true or false.
1. 3 > 4
2. "blue" == "yellow"
3. "employee" == "on_shift"***

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

***Using an if-statement checks whether a condition is met and whether to perform an action.***

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

***"if", followed by "elsif", followed by "else", then "end".***

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

***Adding "&&" between conditions indicates they both must be true to pass as true. Adding "||" between conditions indicates either can be true for them to pass as true.***

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

***There are multiple:
== checks whether the value of two operands are equal.
!= checks whether the two operands are not equal.
> (>=) checks whether the left operand is greater than (or greater or equal to) the right operand.
< (<=) checks whether the right operand is greater than (or greater or equal to) the right operand.***

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

***One more way would be to created nested conditional statements, where each condition leads to determinations between other conditions.***
